CFL Reachability Components
===========================

Advanced CFL reachability algorithms and graph analysis frameworks.

Classical CFL Reachability
--------------------------

Grammar-driven CFL reachability utilities and solver backends

**Location**: ``include/CFL/Classical/``, ``lib/CFL/Classical/``. Both trees
use ``Core/``, ``Solvers/Engines/`` (including ``PEARL/``, ``POCR/``,
``SQID/``, and ``STG/``), ``Solvers/Preprocessing/``, ``Clients/Alias/``, and
``Clients/ValueFlow/``.
The two client implementations consistently use ``AliasClient.*`` and
``ValueFlowClient.*`` filenames.

**Features**:

* One canonical grammar parser with EBNF expansion and binary normalization
* Labeled graph construction for text, DOT, PAG, and PEG-style encodings
* Sparse-set, sparse-bitvector, Graspan epoch/delta, transitive-specialized,
  POCR/hierarchical-POCR, and fully ordered edge-critical-graph backends
* PEARL multi-derivation, Sqid relation chaining, and Stg staged solving
* Native POCR grammar/graph input, unidirectional summarization, client graph
  simplification, and RSM-guided foldability checking
* Incremental solver sessions for dynamically discovered terminal edges
* Adapters for Lotus AserPTA constraint graphs and Lotus SVFG value flow
* End-to-end LLVM bitcode alias analysis with CFL-driven indirect calls
* End-to-end context-sensitive LLVM value-flow analysis over Lotus SVFGs
* Strong-update-aware CFL preparation for Lotus SVFGs

See :doc:`pearl`, :doc:`stg`, and :doc:`sqid` for paper references, key ideas,
algorithm walkthroughs, and exact source mappings.

Interleaved-Dyck Core
---------------------

Shared typed ``Label``, ``Edge``, ``Graph``, and ``Pair`` types plus the DOT
parser used by interleaved-Dyck benchmark datasets.

**Location**: ``include/CFL/InterleavedDyck/Core/``,
``lib/CFL/InterleavedDyck/Core/``

StagedBounds consumes this graph directly, Unary applies unary projection,
and MCFL converts it through a typed-to-generic adapter.

Exact Unary Interleaved Dyck
----------------------------

Exact component reachability for bidirected unary
``D1``-interleaved-``D1``. The module provides adaptive counter flattening and
the POPL 2022 fixed-counter exact baseline.

**Location**: ``include/CFL/InterleavedDyck/Unary/``,
``lib/CFL/InterleavedDyck/Unary/``

See :doc:`interleaved_dyck_unary` for both algorithms, their exactness boundary,
and benchmark eligibility rules.

Interleaved-Dyck Staged Bounds
------------------------------

Staged under- and overapproximation for reachability under two interleaved
families of Dyck constraints.

**Location**: ``include/CFL/InterleavedDyck/StagedBounds/``,
``lib/CFL/InterleavedDyck/StagedBounds/``

This component computes a certified union-Dyck lower bound and progressively
tighter projected-CFL upper bounds; it is not an exact solver for the general
typed problem.

**Features**:

* DOT parsing for parenthesis, bracket, and neutral edges
* Dyck-over-the-union underapproximation
* Projected-language intersection and derivation-tracing mutual refinement
* Stronger parity grammar and pairwise on-demand refinement
* Taint and value-flow benchmark modes

Multiple Context-Free Language Reachability
-------------------------------------------

All-pairs reachability for non-deleting, non-permuting MCFGs and the POPL 2025
typed underapproximation hierarchy.

**Location**: ``include/CFL/InterleavedDyck/MCFL/``, ``lib/CFL/InterleavedDyck/MCFL/``

**Features**:

* All five normal-form MCFL rule types with structural validation
* Indexed worklist saturation and tuple reachability pruning
* Concrete path witnesses from retained derivation DAGs
* ``G_d^circ`` and ``G_d^+`` grammar generation for arbitrary dimensions
* Artifact-compatible staged condensation, DOT input, and command-line tool
* Adapter from the shared typed interleaved-Dyck graph

CSIndex (Context-Sensitive Indexing)
------------------------------------

Context-sensitive indexing for CFL reachability.

**Location**: ``include/CFL/CSIndex/``, ``lib/CFL/CSIndex/``

The implementation is split into ``FLARE`` and ``SCS``. FLARE owns the
extended-Dyck graph and indexing algorithms; SCS builds policy products and
then reuses FLARE. See :doc:`csindex` for the public namespaces and directory
layout.

**Features**: Context-aware indexing algorithms for efficient CFL queries.

**Components**:
* Context-sensitive graph indexing
* Reachability query optimization
* Memory-efficient representations


Interleaved-Dyck Graph Reduction
--------------------------------

PLDI 2020 interleaved-Dyck graph simplification. This component transforms a
DOT graph and does not itself return the final reachability relation.

**Location**: ``lib/CFL/InterleavedDyck/GraphReduction/``

**Features**:

* Two-color summary construction and degree-based node merging
* Iterative Python orchestration until no further edge is removed
* Explicit directed versus already-bidirected input mode
* Private legacy summary representation under the ``lib`` subtree

Mutual Refinement
-----------------

Grammar-agnostic CNF reachability and derivation tracing used by refinement
experiments and by ``StagedBounds``.

**Location**: ``lib/CFL/InterleavedDyck/MutualRefinement/``

**Features**:

* Integer-encoded ``CnfGrammar`` and ``CnfGraph`` representation
* CFL saturation with unary and binary derivation records
* Backward closure to contributing input edges
* Opt-in factorized tracing that reconstructs contributing edges from the
  saturated relations without recording derivations
* Generic file-driven alternating-refinement experiment

It does not own typed delimiter semantics, approximation grammars, benchmark
preprocessing, or lower/upper-bound interpretation;
those belong to
``StagedBounds``.
