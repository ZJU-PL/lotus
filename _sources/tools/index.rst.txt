Command-Line Tools
==================

Lotus provides various command-line tools for alias analysis, CFL reachability,
bug detection, PDG querying, abstract interpretation, and model checking.

This section focuses on the primary front-end binaries built from ``tools/``.
The documentation is organized by subdirectory to match the source structure.

For a feature-oriented walk-through, see :doc:`../user_guide/tutorials` and
:doc:`../user_guide/bug_detection`.
