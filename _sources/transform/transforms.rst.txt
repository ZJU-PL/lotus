Transform Passes
================

Lotus provides a collection of LLVM IR transformation passes under ``lib/Transform``.
These passes are primarily used to normalize and simplify bitcode before running
analyses (alias analysis, numerical abstract interpretation, symbolic abstraction)
or to build light-weight optimization pipelines.

Overview
--------

Use these passes when you need IR that is easier for analyses and tools to consume:

- **Core normalization**: simplify PHI/select/constant expressions so downstream
  analyses do not need to handle every LLVM IR corner case.
- **Memory and data canonicalization**: make aggregates, GEPs, and global
  initializers easier to reason about.
- **Control-flow cleanup**: remove dead blocks, normalize loop latches, and give
  blocks stable names.
- **Optimization helpers**: light-weight inlining and loop/vector transforms used
  by ``ModuleOptimizer`` and custom pipelines.

All passes live in ``lib/Transform`` and are exposed as standard LLVM passes.

Core Transforms
---------------

Normalization passes that rewrite IR into a simpler, analysis-friendly form.

**Location**: ``lib/Transform``

**Main passes**:

- **ElimPhi** – Convert PHI nodes to explicit select or copy operations when possible.
- **ExpandAssume** – Expand ``llvm.assume`` intrinsics into explicit branches and checks.
- **FlattenInit** – Normalize complex global initializers into flat, explicit forms.
- **LowerConstantExpr** – Lower ``ConstantExpr`` nodes into instructions so analyses
  can work over a uniform instruction set.
- **LowerSelect** – Lower ``select`` instructions into equivalent branch-based control flow.
- **MergeReturn** – Merge multiple ``return`` instructions into a single exit block.

**Typical use cases**:

- Prepare bitcode for alias or numerical analyses that assume instruction-level IR.
- Simplify unusual IR patterns produced by front-ends or optimizers.
- Make control-flow and data-flow graphs easier to traverse.

**Basic usage (C\+\+)**:

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include <Transform/LowerConstantExpr.h>

   llvm::Module &M = ...;
   LowerConstantExpr Pass;
   bool Changed = Pass.runOnModule(M);

Memory and Data Transforms
--------------------------

Transformations that simplify memory layout and aggregate operations.

**Location**: ``lib/Transform``

**Main passes**:

- **LowerGlobalConstantArraySelect** – Lower selects over constant global arrays
  to simpler forms.
- **MergeGEP** – Merge chained GEP instructions into a single GEP when possible.
- **SimplifyExtractValue** – Simplify ``extractvalue`` instructions on aggregates.
- **SimplifyInsertValue** – Simplify ``insertvalue`` instructions on aggregates.

**Typical use cases**:

- Canonicalize pointer arithmetic and field accesses before pointer analysis.
- Reduce the number of aggregate operations that downstream passes must understand.
- Improve readability of IR when inspecting transformed modules.

Control-Flow Transforms
-----------------------

Transformations that restructure and clean up control flow.

**Location**: ``lib/Transform``

**Main passes**:

- **RemoveDeadBlock** – Eliminate unreachable or trivially dead basic blocks.
- **RemoveNoRetFunction** – Remove calls to known non-returning functions and
  tidy up unreachable code.
- **SimplifyLatch** – Normalize loop latch structure to a canonical form.
- **NameBlock** – Assign stable, human-readable names to basic blocks.

**Typical use cases**:

- Cleanup after aggressive inlining or partial optimization.
- Prepare IR for analyses that assume canonical loop shapes.
- Improve the stability of analysis results and debug dumps.

Optimization and Pipeline Transforms
------------------------------------

Passes that implement light-weight optimizations or orchestrate multiple transforms.

**Location**: ``lib/Transform``

**Main passes**:

- **ModuleOptimizer** – Driver pass that runs a sequence of Lotus transforms and
  LLVM optimizations on a module.
- **SoftFloat** – Replace hardware floating-point operations with software implementations.
- **UnrollVectors** – Unroll short vector operations when profitable.
- **Unrolling** – Loop unrolling transforms for selected loops.
- **AInliner** – Aggressive inliner tuned for analysis-friendly IR.

**Typical use cases**:

- Build an analysis-friendly optimization pipeline before running CLAM, Sprattus,
  or alias analyses.
- Experiment with different levels of inlining and loop/vector transformations.
- Replace floating-point operations in environments without hardware FP support.

**Pipeline usage example (C\+\+)**:

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include <Transform/ModuleOptimizer.h>
   #include <Transform/UnrollVectors.h>

   llvm::Module &M = ...;

   ModuleOptimizer Optimizer;
   UnrollVectors VectorUnroller;

   bool Changed =
       Optimizer.runOnModule(M) ||
       VectorUnroller.runOnModule(M);
