# Development

For Summer Research, Final Year Project Topics, etc.

## 1. Testing Improvements

- Different OS, LLVM, Z3, Boost, etc.
- Use lib/Alias/Dynamic to test pointer analyses.

## 2. Alias Analysis

### Infrastructure

- Specificatin: use lib/Annotation to enable the loading of aliasing specification files for the pointer analyses (And perhpas use dynamic analysis/ML to extract specifications)
- Data structure: integrate different representations of points-to sets.

### Interfaces

Universal interface for the analyses in lib/Alias: 

- Basics: points-to, alias pair, alias set, pointed-by, callgraph, memory dependence, etc.
- Pointer queries: points-to, alias pair, alias set, pointed-by set
- Callgraph: callgraph edges, reachable methods, etc.
- Optimizations: devirtualization, dead code elimination, ...
- Security: bug finding, guided fuzzing, control-flow integrity, code pointer integrity, ...
- IR: Memory SSA, SSI, DDG, PDG, SDG, SVFG, ...
- Slicing: forward, backward, thin slicing, tropping, ...

**Note**: Currently, we may not focus on some "high-level clients" such as taint analysis and memory safety verification, which can require more reasoning capabilities dataflow tracking, numerical analysis, path sensitivity, etc.

We have AliasWrapper.cpp that wraps various alias analyses (to be tested),


### Third-Party

* Integrate the pointer analyses in SVF and DG


## 3. Intermediate Representations (IR) 

### VFG (Value Flow Graph)

The DyckAA module has a DyckVFG, which is used by the null pointer analysis (lib/NullPointer).
Maybe we can design a VFG independent from DyckAA (e.g., it can use the results of other pointer analyses)

### PDG (Program Dependence Graph)

* Use the pointer analysis interfaces (currently, it relies on the memory dependence analysis inside LLVM)


Implement other algorithms

- TSE 22: The Duality in Computing SSA Programs and Control Dependency
- SAS 22: Fast and Incremental Computation of Weak Control Closure
- TOPLAS 21: On Time-sensitive Control Dependencies

## 4. Applications 

### Slicing

Use VFG or PDG to answer slicing queries.

* Program chopping
* Thin slicing
* ...

(Maybe refer to the implementation in DG)

### Bug Detection

- Buffer overflow detection?
- Memory leak detection?
- Race condition analysis?

## 5. Numerical Analysis

* Integrate abstract interpretation frameworks (e.g., IKOS, CLAM/Crab)

## 6. Data Flow Analysis

* Revise the monotone data flow analysis module
* Let the WPDS engine work
